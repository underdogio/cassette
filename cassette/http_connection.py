"""Contains mock HTTPConnection objects that imitate the behavior of
HTTPConnection from httplib. Cassette works by monkeypatching HTTPConnection
to check if a certain request has been cached already.

Note that although requests, urllib3 and urllib2 all use httplib, urllib3
uses its own, subclassed, version of HTTPConnection. So to make requests work,
we need to mock and patch this object.
